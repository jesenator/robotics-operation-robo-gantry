# robotics-operation-robo-gantry

*The goal:* Build a remotely controlled robot to place a piece into an operation game board with a user interface that allows for remote operation.

Jackson and I, diverging from the conventional car with an arm on top designs, choose to go with what is best described as a robot gantry on wheels.
